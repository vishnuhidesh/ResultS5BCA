### Install all the requirements
in the terminal, run <br>
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Put all the actual result pdfs provided by the university into the 'reservoir' folder, and run Analyse.py

Disclaimer: Use the exact pdf downloaded from the university website, and only of S5. no screenshots, images, photographs, or even screenshots made into pdfs.
This code logic is not designed to perform OCR, instead, it works via line indexing, static indexing and regular expressions, which means copyable text should be in the pdf (which is, the original pdf downloaded from the university result website). So it is pointless to provide images, screenshots, or screenshots turned into pdf into this code.

NB: This code is under alpha testing.
